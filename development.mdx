</Info>

Step 1. Install Stateset on your OS:

<CodeGroup>

```jsx bash
git clone https://github.com/stateset/stateset-one
```

</CodeGroup>

Step 2. Go to the are located (where you can find `stateset.json`) and run the following command:

```bash
stateset dev
```

The platform is now available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Custom Ports

Stateset uses port 3000 by default. You can use the `--port` flag to customize the port Stateset runs on. For example, use this command to run in port 3333:

```bash
stateset dev --port 3333
```

You will see an error like this if you try to run Stateset in a port that's already taken:

```md
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```
