# ReSponse AI Functions

ReSponse AI Functions are a way to extend the functionality of ReSponse AI. They are written in JavaScript and can be used to perform a variety of tasks, such as:

- Sending emails
- Sending SMS messages
- Creating a return
- Creating a refund
- Changing an Order
- Pausing a Subscription

## Creating a Function

To create a function, navigate to the Functions section of the ReSponse AI dashboard and click the "Create Function" button.

This will create a new function with a default name and description. You can edit these by clicking on the name or description.

For example an API for Sending and Verifying a Code via Email could be created as follows:

```javascript

        let function_list = [
            {
                "type": "function",
                "function":
                {
                    "name": "send-code",
                    "description": "Sends a code to the user via their email",
                    "parameters": {
                        "type": "object",
                        "properties": {
                            "email": {
                                "type": "string",
                                "description": "the email to be used to send the code to the user"
                            },
                            "code": {
                                "type": "string",
                                "description": "the code that needs to be sent to the user"
                            }
                        },
                        "required": ["email", "code"]
                    },
                }
            },
            {
                "type": "function",
                "function":
                {
                    "name": "verify-code",
                    "description": "Verifies a code that was sent to the user via their email",
                    "parameters": {
                        "type": "object",
                        "properties": {
                            "email": {
                                "type": "string",
                                "description": "the email that was used to send the code to the user"
                            },
                            "code": {
                                "type": "string",
                                "description": "the code that needs to be verfied by the user"
                            }
                        },
                        "required": ["email", "code"]
                    },
                }
            }
        ];
```

## Using a Function

Then the request will be made to the model using the functions as the tools:

```javascript

        // Chat Completion Request Options
        var chatCompletionRequestOptions = {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: {
                'Content-Type': 'application/json',
                'Authorization': process.env.OPEN_AI
            },
            body: JSON.stringify({
                model: 'gpt-4-1106-preview',
                tools: function_list,
                tool_choice: "auto",
                messages: chat_history
            }),
            redirect: 'follow'
        };

        var chat_output;
        var message_body;

        // Create a first ReSponse which does the Completion API
        const response = await fetch("https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions", chatCompletionRequestOptions);
        const json = await response.json();

```
