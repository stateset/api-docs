### Quickstart Guide

1) Setup your company's Stateset One instance by signing up at <a href="https://stateset.io/signup">stateset.io/signup</a>

2) Create a new API Key in the Stateset Cloud Console <a href="https://cloud.stateset.com/api-keys">cloud.stateset.com/api-keys</a>

3) Install the stateset-node SDK in your project:

```jsx
npm install stateset-node
```

4) Create a new Warranty

```jsx

import { stateset } from 'stateset-node'('API_KEY');

const warranty = await stateset.warranties.create({
  id: 'W-123313',
  order_id: 'O-12332312',
  serial_number: 'st123976879tm',
  'description:' 'Warranty Replacement for different type',
  'status': 'NEW'
  'reported_condition': 'A',
  'tracking_number': '132908231098120921',
  'zendesk_number': '123313',
  'action_needed': 'Replacement'
  'rma': 'W-123312',
  'country': 'US'
});

```

5) Approve Warranty

```jsx

import { stateset } from 'stateset-node'('API_KEY');

const warranty = await stateset.warranties.approve(
 'W-123313'
);

```

### Advanced Warranty Automation using Temporal

```jsx javascript

import { condition, proxyActivities } from '@temporalio/workflow';
import * as wf from '@temporalio/workflow';

const { userReturnedProduct, createZendeskComment, voidInvoice, updateWarranty, updateWorkflowId } = proxyActivities({
    startToCloseTimeout: '1 minute',
});

/** A workflow that simply calls an activity */
export async function warrantyConditionUpdatedWorkflow(body, zendesk_number) {

    let workflow_state = [];
    var condition = _condition;
    var replacement_order_created = _replacement_order_created;
    var ticket_id_int = zendesk_number;

    if ((replacement_order_created == true && condition == "A") || (replacement_order_created == true && condition == "B") || (replacement_order_created == true && condition == "C")) {

        // Void Invoice
        await voidInvoice(customer_email);

        // Create Zendesk Comment
        await createZendeskComment(ticket_id_int);

    } else if ((replacement_order_created == true && condition == "F")) {

        // Create Zendesk Comment
        await createZendeskComment(ticket_id_int);
    }
    
    await userReturnedProduct(customer_email);

    // Update Warranty
    var warranty_id = await updateWarranty();

    // Update Workflow Id
    await updateWorkflowId(warranty_id, wf.workflowInfo().workflowId);


    return 'updated'

}

```
