The Manufacturing & Production module in Stateset includes various objects that facilitate manufacturing and production processes. These objects typically encompass:

- Cycle Counts
- Inventory

### Quickstart Guide

2) Create a new API Key in the Stateset Cloud Console <a href="https://cloud.stateset.com/api-keys">cloud.stateset.com/api-keys</a>

3) Install the stateset-node SDK in your project:

```jsx
npm install stateset-node
```

4) Create a new Stateset Client

```jsx

import { stateset } from 'stateset-node'('API_KEY');

const created = await stateset.billofmaterials.create(
  'bom_ODkRWQtx9NVsRX'
);

```
