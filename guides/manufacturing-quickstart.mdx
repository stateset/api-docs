Stateset One provides a REST and GraphQL API for Manufacting and Production

The Manufacturing & Production module in Stateset includes various objects that facilitate manufacturing and production processes. These objects typically encompass:

- Bill of Materials (BOM)
- Work Orders
- Manufacturing Orders
- Picks
- Cycle Counts
- Inventory

### Quickstart Guide

1) Setup your company's Stateset One instance by signing up at <a href="https://stateset.io/signup">stateset.io/signup</a>

2) Create a new API Key in the Stateset Cloud Console <a href="https://cloud.stateset.com/api-keys">cloud.stateset.com/api-keys</a>

3) Install the stateset-node SDK in your project:

```jsx
npm install stateset-node
```

4) Create a new Bill of Materials

```jsx javascript   

import { stateset } from 'stateset-node'('API_KEY');

const created = await stateset.billofmaterials.create(
  'bom_ODkRWQtx9NVsRX'
);

```


5) Create a Work Order

Work Orders serve as instructions for the production team, providing guidance on the specific tasks, operations, and steps needed to manufacture a product. Stateset enables the creation, tracking, and management of work orders, ensuring efficient production execution.

```jsx javascript

import { stateset } from 'stateset-node'('API_KEY');

const created = await stateset.workorder.create(
        "work_order_and_work_order_line_items": {
        "id": id,
        "type": type,
        "status": status,
        "priority": priority,
        "number": number,
        "site": site,
        "bill_of_material_number": bill_of_materials_number,
        "work_order_line_items": {
          "data": JSON.parse(bill_of_material_line_item_data)
        }
    }
);

```
